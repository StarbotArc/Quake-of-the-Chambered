Note: This was a project I worked for fun at the beginning of my job; The source quality is: BAD.

Welcome to the Decay of the Goddess - github page!

This mod is based on the game "Prelude of the Chambered" which was developed by Notch within 48 hours for the ludum Dare contest.

Features:

In game bash - An in game bash which lets the player communicate with the game.
Mouse support - move the camera around the x-axis or use it to navigate through the menu.
Config-file - a file which contains parameters like resolution, mouse speed, etc.
Added an item (med kit) - Just a test to get to know how the game handles it.
Increased texture size.
Increased color palette.
Completely HUD removal.
Fullscreen support! (Software rendered)

This page will be replaced in the future. It shows the current list of features I've worked out so far.
If you've got any questions, wishes or proposals - write me a mail, a pm, via icq, twitter or a nice comment :)
