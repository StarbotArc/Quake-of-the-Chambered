# Quake of the Chambered

I have been a large fan of Markus (Notch) Persson's Prelude of the Chambered rendering engine, and I've always loved tinkering around with it to make it do new things, as well as optimise the code. Well, this time I've decided to make a "serious" project out of it.

My initial plan for this project is to create a networked, fast-paced, and overall more hardcore version of Markus Persson's original game/engine.

Development has just now started, and I plan on updating the project as time goes on. 

All credit goes to benjaminfoo for writing the original code for 'Decay of the Goddess', which is a mod of the Prelude of the Chambered engine that allows for such things like bash support and mouselook.

Anyway, time to start crackin' :D

This README file should update over time.
